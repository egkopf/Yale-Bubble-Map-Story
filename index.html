    <h1>The Yale Coffee Ecosystem</h1>
    <div class="byline">By Ethan Kopf</div>

    <!-- Rest of the HTML content remains exactly the same -->
    <p style="text-align: center;">Overview: The story that I aim to tell begins with asking the reader to consider the
        concept of Yale dominating the food and drink industry in areas of New Haven, with a case study on the “quick
        stop for coffee or a snack before or after a class”. With what frequency do Yale students choose to go to
        privately-owned, non-Yale coffee shops, where they may be surrounded by non-Yale-affiliated residents of New
        Haven, and served by non-Yale-employed people? And conversely, to what degree has Yale’s establishment of
        University coffee shops drawn students into Yale spaces who would have otherwise chosen to get their coffee or
        snack at a non-Yale space?
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        I have been inspired to analyze this concept of the Yale “Coffee and Snack” Bubble because of my own distaste
        for Yale’s inclusion of “points” on the partial meal plans. The restrictions on how these points can be spent
        have compelled me to get my coffee increasingly from the Elm so as not to lose the points, while I would prefer
        to enjoy time at and patronize independent organizations for coffee and snacks. I hope to show that Yale’s
        establishment of the Elm, Steep Café, and the Silliman Acorn have significantly impacted students’ decision
        making surrounding buying coffee and snacks. Added up, these small shifts in student behavior collectively
        strengthen the 'Yale Bubble' by drawing daily coffee and snack routines - normally opportunities for community
        interaction - into Yale-controlled spaces.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Hook: The underground café known as The Elm draws long lines of Yale students eager for coffee or a snack
        between classes. It’s a windowless café in a basement: what about the Elm would draw such crowds of people?
    </p>
    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat A: <span style="color: orange;">Where are Yale Students?
        </h2>

        <p>Map of the top-10 Yale buildings by student class attendance. This map should demonstrate geographic area
            within New Haven where students are most frequently found during the school day. Intention is to familiarize
            the reader with the traffic patterns of students across Yale and non-Yale spaces.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat B: <span style="color: orange;">What was Yale like in 2008?

        </h2>

        <p>Homing in on New Haven in 2008, before the opening of Bass Café (2008), KBT/Steep Café (2011), the Silliman
            Acorn (2017), or the Elm (2021). This map will highlight the proximity of classroom buildings to commercial
            areas in New Haven. It is not necessarily meant to claim that students commonly patronized independent
            organizations for coffee and snacks before and after classes, but rather to demonstrate the time before
            students were in the habit of relying on Yale spaces for these activities.
        </p>

        <h4>Then we got Bass Café...</h4>
        <p class="imageCaption">[map changes]</p>

    </div>
    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat C: <span style="color: orange;">How did student’s coffee and snack patterns change by 2017?

        </h2>

        <p>Moving into New Haven in 2017, with a spotlight on the Silliman Acorn and Steep Café. Primary focus on the
            proximity to Yale classroom buildings, to demonstrate that the closest coffee shop to so many students as
            they leave or enter a class has changed from a non-Yale-run coffee shop to now be a Yale-run coffee shop.
            Silliman Acorn and Steep Café are two Yale-owned cafés with different management structures, and I intend to
            supplement the geographic data with textual information about how Yale has used its advantage as a
            university to make these two options especially appealing to students: prices subsidized by the University
            and integration into the meal plan system.

        </p>

        <h4>Next came Silliman Acorn...</h4>
        <p class="imageCaption">[map changes]</p>
        <h4>And Steep Café...</h4>

    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat D: <span style="color: orange;">In 2025, where do Yale students go for their coffee and snacks?


        </h2>

        <p>Yale today, displaying the full map, showing the connections between each classroom building and the nearest
            place a student can buy coffee or a snack, with clear indication of which are Yale-run and which are not
            Yale run. Potential features on the struggles of the independent coffee businesses on the periphery of
            Yale’s campus. The reader should now have a renewed understanding of how Yale, in just over a decade, has
            successfully captured a large market share of students’ desires to grab a coffee or a snack in between
            classes.

    </div>

    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat E: <span style="color: orange;">Broadly, what is the extent of Yale’s expansion into new food and drink
                markets?

        </h2>

        <p>Expanding the lens of the project to Yale’s shift away from the feeling of being a city school through
            development of civic-like spaces. Building the Well at the Schwartzman center indicates a new self-identity
            of Yale as a site for nightlife. The grab-and-go service from commons aims to capture the market for
            early/late lunches by extending hours to 11am-3pm. Butteries capture the late-night snack market.

        </p>


    </div>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Kicker: a feature on the massively long lines at the Elm. Intention is to show that despite having no windows, a
        sterile interior design, and average food and drink quality, the draws of the <b>convenient</b> location,
        <b>exclusivity</b>
        of the space to non-Yale affiliates and integration with the Yale <b>meal plan</b> are sufficient to turn crowds
        of
        Yale students inwards into the university for their coffee and snack needs.

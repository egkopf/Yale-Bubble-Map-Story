    <h1>Kopf Bubble Map Outline v2</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 40px;">The story that I aim to tell begins with asking the reader to
        consider the concept of a quick stop for coffee or
        a snack before or after a class. With what frequency do Yale students choose to go to privately-owned, non-Yale
        coffee shops, where they may be surrounded by non-Yale-affiliated residents of New Haven, and served by
        non-Yale-employed people? And conversely, to what degree has Yale’s establishment of University coffee shops
        drawn students into Yale spaces who would have otherwise chosen to get their coffee or snack at a non-Yale
        space?
    </p>

    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat 1: <span style="color: orange;">New Haven</span> is a town in CT</h2>

        <p>Map of the top-10 Yale buildings by student class attendance. This map should demonstrate geographic area
            within New Haven where students are most frequently found during the school day. Intention is to familiarize
            the reader with the traffic patterns of students across Yale and non-Yale spaces.</p>

    <div class="beat">
        <h2>Beat 2: Yale University is located smack dab in the middle of New Haven</h2>

        <p>Homing in on New Haven in 2011, before the opening of Steep Café, the Silliman Acorn, or the Elm.
            This map
            will highlight the proximity of classroom buildings to commercial areas in New Haven. It is not
            necessarily
            meant to claim that students commonly patronized independent organizations for coffee and snacks
            before and
            after classes, but rather to demonstrate the time before students were in the habit of relying on
            Yale
            spaces for these activities.</p>
